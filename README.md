# comp421

Database systems project where we designed a database application for a travelling agency. Users can book flights, hotel rooms or rent cars. In P1, we created relational schemas and E/R diagrams, in P2 we translated it to a SQL relational schema and loaded some data to our database (DB2), and in P3 we implemented a user-firendly interface for users to interact with our application. P3 was done using Java by connecting to the DBMS via JDBC.
